# R2RML Parser

An R2RML implementation that can export relational database contents as RDF graphs, based on an [R2RML](http://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) mapping document. Contains an R2RML [mapping document](https://github.com/nkons/r2rml-parser/blob/master/dspace/dspace-mapping.rdf) for the [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/) institutional repository solution. Early results presented in [1]. More up-to-date results in the [wiki](https://github.com/nkons/r2rml-parser/wiki).

## Implementation details

R2RML implementation written fully in Java 7, using Apache Jena 2.7, Spring 3.2, JUnit 4.8, and Maven 3.0. Tested against MySQL 5.6 and PostgreSQL 9.2.
