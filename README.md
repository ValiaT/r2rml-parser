Contains an R2RML [mapping document](https://github.com/nkons/r2rml-parser/blob/master/dspace/dspace-mapping.rdf) for the [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/) institutional repository solution. Early results presented in [1]. More up-to-date results in the [wiki](https://github.com/nkons/r2rml-parser/wiki).
